# Nums

A calculator written in C using GTK4.

This project is my first attempt to apply the techniques expressed in the [GTK tutorials](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/getting_started.html).

This is meant to be a learning experience, not an amazing calculator! If you have come to evaluate the code please feel free to suggest improvements that would help me learn to use GTK better.
